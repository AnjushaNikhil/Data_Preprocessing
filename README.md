# Data_Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in preparing raw data for analysis in machine learning projects. It involves various techniques to clean, transform, and organize data to make it suitable for model training. Common preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting data into training and testing sets. Proper data preprocessing ensures that machine learning models can learn effectively from the data, leading to more accurate predictions and insights.

In this repository, you'll find code examples and explanations of different data preprocessing techniques used in our machine learning projects. Understanding and implementing proper data preprocessing techniques is essential for building robust and reliable machine learning models.
